# Absolute Roleplay

Absolute Roleplay is a plugin for FFXIV focused on streamlining roleplay for the end users.
For now this plugin is mainly focused on roleplay profiles such as one you would normally create with carrd.
You can view other peoples profiles (If not set to private or whitelisted) and bookmark them.
You can create profiles for a multitude of things such as venues, characters, groups and so on.

Current profile sections include...

BIO::
A profile bio to specify things such as your age, height, weight, alignment, at first glance, and so on.

DETAILS::
Individual fields with a title and content to organize information about your profile.

STORY::
Create compelling stories with chapter creation and management.

INFO::
Specify things people should know about yourself or your profile.

GALLERY::
Add image url's to a list to display images in your gallery. (Image uploading coming hopefully soon.)

CUSTOM TABS
Create your own layouts and even use a html-like tag system to create your own layouts.


PRIVACY:
Set your profile to private so only whitelisted players can see it.
