1. No hateful or discriminating comments against any group or race or gender in your OOC or other sections of your profile. (This applies to every group race and gender.)

2. Use NSFW and Triggering tags appropriately.

3. No IRL politics or social stances regardless of what stance you are taking in your RP profiles. Keep them IC. (This does not apply to your OOC section)

4. You cannot report profiles for content that is not deemed illegal by US law. Repeat false reports or unwarranted reports will get you banned.

5. If there is something you don't like seeing in someone's profile the solution is usually simple, don't look at it.

6. Do not list on external sites or any sort of media, lists of player profiles you personally deem to be people not to interact with.
If you are found to be creating such a list or posting it in any sort of manner will get you permabanned.

7. Having a profile in game does not mean you can share the same content in discord. Do not by any means post NSFW or Triggering content in the discord or spoilers of any sort.

8. This plugin may not be a safe space for /everyone, it is simply a place where everyone is welcome. If you find yourself uncomfy with others on the platform, treat it as any in game interaction and do not engage.
